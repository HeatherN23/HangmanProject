# Hangman by Heather Nygaard

#### This project replicates the game Hangman, where the user guesses the letter of a randomly generated mystery word."
#### To play the game, download the game from the repository to your computer.  Navigate to the game directory, and select the Hangman Project file.  
#### Open up the terminal, and at the prompt the user will type: node . to begin the game.  When you are asked if you want to play the game, type: y to start the game.  

## Instructions:
#### 1. Guess the letter of the mystery word.
#### 2. If the letter doesn't appear in the word, it will appear in a letter bank, and a part will be added to the man.
#### 3. If the letter is correct, the program will add it to the Found Words Bank in the position where it occurs in the word.
#### 4. You only get 6 incorrect guesses before your man will be hanged, so choose wisely.
